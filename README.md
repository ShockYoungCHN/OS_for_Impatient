# OS_for_Impatient

This repo include my personal notes taken when I was learning OS in HIT(Weihai) 22 Spring. Most of the notes is quite brief, as I want to helps reader to grasp key points quickly. 

Currently the language is only avaible in Chinese, while some of the content is English. I also notice that some of the topics is not completed. Things will be updated continously. Thanks for your views and stars!

Ref Repo: [Osteps](https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-translations) Forget the OS stuff you are reading now, You should definitely read this one!
