# 锁

作为线程同步章节的补充，本文旨在详细介绍各种锁，同时bridge the gap between `操作系统` and `具体语言（java&go）`中锁的实现。



互斥（一个资源只能由一个进程占用）；占用并等待；非抢占（资源不能被抢占）；循环等待；

## Pre-Knowledge

### Graph to present Deadlock

#### Resource-Allocation Graph



#### Wait-for Graph



### 4 necessary conditions causing deadlock

>`Mutual Exclusion`
>
>`Hold and Wait`
>
>`No preemption`
>
>`Circular Wait`

To prevent the deadlock, each of the conditions above corresponds to a solution:

>Prevent `Mutual Exclusion` (which is almost impossible!)
>
>Prevent `Circular Wait`: Defining a linear ordering of resource types (known as "有序资源使用法")

#### Strict Proof

why "Defining a linear ordering of resource types" could Prevent `Circular Wait`?

> If the sources are allocated to $P_i$ by "a linear ordering of resource types", then `circular wait` won't happen

> Suppose there are $n$ processes $S_P={P_1, P_2, ..., P_n}$ and $m$ resources $S_R={R_1, R_2, ..., R_m}$, where each process requires a subset of the resources to complete its execution.

For simplicity, we can assume that the resources are numbered from 1 to $m$, and the ordering is such that $R_1 < R_2 < ... < R_m$.

## Locks in OS

### Mutex



### Semaphore

> "one needs both locks and condition variables to solve a broad range of relevant and interesting concurrency problems. One of the first people to realize this years ago was Edsger Dijkstra." (Remzi, P1, [threads-sema.pdf](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Classes/537/Fall2021/Book/threads-sema.pdf))

Dijkstra says let there be semaphore, then there is semaphore. 

Semaphore is not a lock, but can be used a lock.

#### Application

##### Binary Sema(Locks)

##### Code running in order

##### Producer/Consumer

##### The Dining Philosophers

###### Background

The problem is that each philosopher needs two chopsticks to eat, one on the left and one on the right. If a philosopher takes a chopstick, it cannot be used by another philosopher until he/she puts it down. This leads to a potential deadlock where all the philosophers are holding one chopstick and waiting for the other one.

###### Code that not perfect



###### Solution

<font color=red>KEY: change how forks are acquired by at least one of the philosophers</font>



>

here simply using semaphore to break the **Circular wait** condition





##### Thread Throttling

#### Implementation



#### Flaws in Semaphore



### Monitor

monitor is used for multiple threads to access the shared resources exclusively

**composition of monitor**：<font color=red>A lock (control of exclusively access to the monitor code)；Multiple conditional variables and a series of corresponding operations（conditional variables are used to manage concurrent access, A conditional variable corresponds to a waiting queue, each variable has wait and signal operations）</font>

## 悲观锁

synchronized是悲观锁，可以修饰实例方法，静态方法，代码块。

synchronized基于互斥锁实现，在 Java 中，每个对象都有一个管程（Monitor），当线程进入 `synchronized` 代码块时，会尝试获取对象的管程，并在代码块执行完成后释放管程。当一个线程获取到了对象的管程后，其他线程就需要等待，直到当前线程释放管程。
